# Frontier-Airlines-Tableau-Visualization
In this project, my team mates and I extracted and cleaned the data of various airlines for a period of one year and created visuals to identify their flight delay patterns.  We evaluated the flight delay pattern of Frontier airlines to determine the reasons behind the flight delays and came up with recommendations to reduce the delays.
